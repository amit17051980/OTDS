# OpenTextâ„¢ Directory Services (OTDS)

## What is OpenText Directory Services?
If you are familiar with IdaaS (Identity as a Service) concept, and have used OKTA/Auth0/Azure-AD, this is quite similar, but it has some main differences:
  1. This is infrastructure independent. i.e. run in local PC or cloud instances or Kubernentes clusters on any Winodws/Unix. 
  2. This provides hybrid approach to replicate users from various sources (AD, LDAP, etc.)
  3. It provides great features to documentum eco system.

Directory Services is a repository of user and group identity information and a collection of services to manage this information for OpenText applications. OTDS contains components for identity synchronization and single sign on for all OpenText applications. Directory Services offers synchronization and authentication features that can help your organization save time, and administrative overhead, by enabling you to maintain user information in one directory, for use by multiple OpenText applications. For example, you can base your OpenText Content Server user information on the user information already contained in your Windows domain. If your organization maintains several Enterprise Server systems, they can all use the same central user directory. Directory Services can synchronize with your identity provider to pull user and group information from your identity provider automatically. Directory Services then pushes these users and groups to your OpenText applications automatically and incrementally. This synchronization of user and group data across OpenText applications allows Directory Services to enable single sign on and secure access to all OpenText applications.
